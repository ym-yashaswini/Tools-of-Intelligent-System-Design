# ECE 657 - Intelligent System Design

Conventional approaches for dealing with complex systems are usually applied under the assumption of a good understanding of the systemâ€™s behavior/functionalities and its operating environment.Recent developments in the area of intelligent systems, operational artificial intelligence and machine learning fundamentals of softcomputing-basedd design approaches using tools such as approximate reasoning, machine learning, connectionist modeling, classification and clustering, deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Implementations and applications in various real world systems fields of engineering including big data analytics, information retrieval, smart grid control, driverless cars, intelligent transportation, intelligent mechatronics, optimization, communication, robotics and manufacturing.
